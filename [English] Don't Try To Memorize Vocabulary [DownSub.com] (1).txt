people try to say well you should try to  learn 10 words a day and really make  sure you can use them and sort of nail  them down  i've never found that effective hi there  steve kaufman here  today i want to talk about  learning vocabulary and why we shouldn't  try to remember vocabulary now if you  enjoy my videos please subscribe click  on the bell for notification if you  follow me on a podcast service please  leave a comment so  i mentioned the other day that i went to  visit my brother who's not well he's  sort of bedridden i gave him an ipad and  i tried to get him going on link so it's  very interesting for me and i speak to  him every couple of days it's very  interesting for me to see his experience  because he's not an experienced language  learner and so he's  learning link and he's getting used to  learning in his case spanish using link  and so he said to me on several  occasions you know i keep on trying to  remember  this sentence or this word and i can't  remember it then it's quite frustrating  and so i  tried to explain to him again that  you know don't worry about not  remembering in fact don't even try to  remember the vocabulary keep moving keep  moving on and eventually the words will  start to stick  and i thought of my own process of  language learning  and  i mean the bulk of my words i learn them  through listening and reading  um  i look words up every time like if i'm  on my lesson page in link if it's a blue  word obviously i look it up in order to  get the meaning it's now a yellow word  but when i come across a yellow word  even if i kind of think i know the  meaning i'll just give another quick  look  and then of course that doesn't mean i  can use it it doesn't mean that i won't  again have to look it up the next time  but it's part of that gradual process of  getting a sense of  what the scope of meaning of the word is  as i see it in different contexts  getting familiar with the word  the word getting familiar with me  and and at some point it starts to click  in and it's very hard to predict when  that's going to happen  and so most of my activity is listening  and reading  noticing things while reading noticing  things while listening but i also do  review  words in lists  uh and i've said that i'll sometimes  pick you know the status three the sort  of familiar words to try and move some  to known to pad my  known words  number  uh  i'll sometimes look at them in  alphabetical order just to see the words  that have the same  you know prefix because that can help  if i do flashcards i want all the  information  on the face of the flashcard it's all  just exposure  i don't try to rack my brain in other  words have the either the word in the  target language on the front of the  flash card and then try to think what it  means and flip it over or conversely to  see say the english word and try to  remember what that is  in the target language i don't do those  things some people do i'm not saying  that it's not effective for some people  but for me  i don't believe in it i i feel that if i  can continue to expose  myself or expose these words to my brain  in different ways eventually i will  learn them and i have noticed that  a lot of the words that i learn that are  added to my known words total  are words that i didn't even look up  because words  you know they have things in common and  pretty soon we  know  uh maybe a different tense or a  different person or a different form of  a word that we've already learned  and so without even looking that word up  it's just added to our known words total  because we didn't save it and so the  system considers it known so  i sometimes feel that this sort of  deliberate attempt  to acquire words and and what's  particularly bad is is is it people try  to say well you should try to learn 10  words a day and really make sure you can  use them and sort of nail them down  i've never found that effective i i far  rather  just expose myself to as many words as i  can  rereading old lessons  you know going into new lessons  exposing myself to these words and  gradually lo and behold the statistics  in increase and my known words total all  of a sudden it's 10 000 words  granted the way we count them at link  where each form of the word is  considered a different word  but  the point is  don't in my view don't rely on memory  like a lot of people say to me well i  can't learn languages because  uh i have a poor memory  your poor memory is probably not that  poor it's irrelevant language learning  is not about  memorization language learning is about  committing yourself to a process  enjoying the process  allowing the language to come into you  and trusting that your brain will  gradually understand more and more  gradually acquire more and more words so  my advice on language learning or in  terms of acquiring words and i should  say  accumulating words is the fundamental  task in language learning and so the  more words you have even passively the  better your potential in the language so  it is important to acquire the words but  you're not necessarily going to acquire  words by deliberately trying to remember  them  a couple of videos i'll leave you with  one where i talk about learning 100  words a day  and another one where i talk about  memorization and language learning i did  these a few years ago  hopefully i said the same things then as  i'm saying now  thank you for listening bye for now
